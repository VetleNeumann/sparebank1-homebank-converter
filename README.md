# Sparebank1-HomeBank-Converter

Sparebank1 offers the ability to export transaction history to CSV format. This Python script converts Sparebank1 CSV files, to the HomeBank CSV format.
## Usage/Examples

This package uses only standard Python modules, so no dependencies required.

```shell
# Basic usage:
python3 sparebank1_homebank.py <csv_file>
```

Alternatively, assuming you're on Windows and have associated `.py` files to be opened with the Python interpreter, you may drag-and-drop the CSV files directly onto `sparebank1_homebank.py`.

Converted output file is generated in the same directory as the input CSV file.
